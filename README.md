# La Paper House
La Paper House was an experience in Virtual Reality Made during the SwissNex Hackathon 2019.

The concept of this hackathon was to make a new interaction using a device called Virandola that could be integrated into Mélodie Mousset's Hana Hana experience.

The Virandola consists of a device that uses Arduino and a pinwheel to capture the user's breath during the Experience and can allow player interaction in another way.

The concept behind La Casa de Papel was to create a physical experience simulating the breath where the player could actually interact with objects in the wind-only scenario.




This experience was made by Hackaton members:
- Vinicius Hashirama
- Vinicius Gonçalves
- Vinicius Martins
- Victor Lopes
